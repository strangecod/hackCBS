## Problem Statement
Most of the times children loose their interest in academics because of some reading slump or they find it boring just going through the text. Dyslexia is one of the learning disorder that effects atmost 17% of school aged children in INDIA causing reading disability and difficulty in Learning.

## Solution 
 Our Solution,Safari Adventure,  provides an experience of a virtual learning environment for young kids such that on scanning any respective image of the animal, it will augment the 3D model of it along with their description. It will also have a voice-over of the information that is available in both Hindi and English, rhymes and games at one place which will boost the imagination of the children to understand the concepts through their visualization and listening power rather than just seeing it on books.
